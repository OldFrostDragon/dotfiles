This repository contains my personal dotfiles, configured for macOS and Arch Linux. These dotfiles are designed to enhance the Fish shell experience and are optimized for the Kitty terminal emulator.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the Fish shell installed on your system. You can install Fish and kitty using your system's package manager.

### Installation

To set up these dotfiles on your system, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OldFrostDragon/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

2. Run the installation script:

```bash
./install_dotfiles.sh
```

This script will install Fisher (Fish shell plugin manager), symlink the dotfiles to the appropriate locations, and install the required fonts.
